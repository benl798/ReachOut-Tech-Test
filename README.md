# ReachOut-Tech-Test
We want to build a ReachOut Pokemon browser. This is where our users can expand their knowledge
of Pokemon and see if they have a favourite. We will use use this API: https://pokeapi.co/


## Objectives
The solution has 3 requirements:
* Display a random Pokemon. Include the name and a sprite.
* Let the user find a new random Pokemon - but it can’t be one that the user has already seen or saved.
* Let the user save a Pokemon into a group of “My favourite Pokemon"

## Installation and Setup Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
