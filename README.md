# ReachOut-Tech-Test
We want to build a ReachOut Pokemon browser. This is where our users can expand their knowledge
of Pokemon and see if they have a favourite. We will use use this API: https://pokeapi.co/


## Objectives
The solution has 3 requirements:
* Display a random Pokemon. Include the name and a sprite.
* Let the user find a new random Pokemon - but it can’t be one that the user has already seen or saved.
* Let the user save a Pokemon into a group of “My favourite Pokemon"
